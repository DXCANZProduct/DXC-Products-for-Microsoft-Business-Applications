# Introduction

## Bank statement import and reconciliation

The Cash and Bank Management department can build bank statement format matching with the bank account statement files generated by Bank(s). The finance utilities provide a simplified platform to define the bank statement format definition for various file types.
DXC Finance Utilities supports the following formats:
-	Flat file
-	NAI
-	BAI2
-	Custom
-	BRS
-	GHS

The Custom format provides some flexibility on configuring additional formats.

The Bank account statements can then be imported into Dynamics 365 based on the statement format definitions. 
 
Matching rules can be executed either during or after the import, to automatically match the bank statement transactions to Dynamics 365 bank transactions. Also, bank transactions can be automatically created, posted and reconciled based on configured matching rules. 
 
Finance utilities minimises the manual actions required for reconciling bank account statement(s) with bank transactions processed in Dynamics 365FO.
