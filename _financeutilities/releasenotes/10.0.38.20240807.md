| 18347  | Cash and bank management    | Bank accounts         | Only enable field 'Include balance line in record count' when field 'Extra balance line on EFT' is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 18550  | Cash and bank management    | Bank reconciliation   | Disable button 'Match id' in Bank reconciliation Worksheet when Financial utilities parameter field 'Auto assign Match Id' is set to _Yes_. Else it errors with 'No statement lines have been marked'. Clicking Match Id is unnecessary as the Match id will automatically be assigned when user clicks button 'Match' in the Bank reconciliation Worksheet.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 18692  | Cash and bank management    | Bank reconciliation   | When feature 'Enable posting of new transactions in bank reconciliation' is enabled, the ability to post mark new transactions are available in the Bank reconciliation Worksheet. If user used this posting, and also posted the bank statement, a duplicate mark new transaction was posted. <br> This was only relevant for offset types Customer (when manually marked as new in Recon - not via recon rule that creates customer payment journal), Vendor or Bank.                                        |
| 18689  | Organisation administration | ABN validation report | Previously when running report 'ABN validation' the API was run for each vendor/customer with an ABN allocated. Since the fields are now stored on the TaxVatNumTable the report will now not run the API anymore. The relevant fields on the TaxVatNumTable can be updated to current Australian Business Register data by either: <br> • Organisation administration > Periodic > Update ABN validation <br> • 'Run update' on 'Organisation administration > Enquiries and reports > ABN validation review. |
