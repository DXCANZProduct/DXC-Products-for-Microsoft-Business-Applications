# Accounts receivable functionality
The fields as described in the following subsections are available to control the additional functionality for accounts receivable.

## Customer approval workflow

When changes are made to specific customer fields, standard D365 customer workflow can be used for approval before the changes are applied to the customer. 
Finance utilities has added additional **Customer bank account** and **Customer** fields that can be managed by the same workflow.

Users can access the **Accounts receivable parameters** page by navigating to **Accounts receivable > Setup > Accounts receivable parameters**. <br>
