# License manager in FinOps

The license manager licensed products can be found under the **System parameters** tab called **Product licenses**.

The **Validate licenses** button can be used to manually trigger validation against the license server.

The same validation will be done automatically once a day when a user loads the default start page for a finance and operations environment, https://<environment base url>/?cmp=<any company>&mi=DefaultDashboard
