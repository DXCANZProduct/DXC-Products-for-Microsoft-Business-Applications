20123 | Customer environment - Support "duplicate" serial | Restored the ability to add multiple tenants for the same serial number in customer environments. This supports scenarios where companies use a temporary, cost-effective tenant (e.g., onmicrosoft.com) prior to go-live, and later transition to their primary domain (e.g., .com).
23075| Web app - License expiry | Fixed issues reported in the License Expiry Report for the upcoming three-month period. The report now accurately reflects licenses approaching expiration.
