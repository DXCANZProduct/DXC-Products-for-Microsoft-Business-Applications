:--	|:--		  |:--	
9767	| Import - batch group with multiple companies			| After moving Batch control to groups, the import batch can fail when another legal entity isn't setup for EDI. This change will ensure the remaining legal entities are still processed.

10442	| Connection type	| New Incoming path type **Error**. Where file already exists in D365 for trading partner and document type, the file will be moved from Import path to Error path. If the Error path isn't setup, the duplicate file will remain in Import path.
10446	| EDI parameters	| Removed **About** tab on EDI parameters

**Customer module**	

Number	| Functionality	  | Reason
:--	|:--		  |:--	
4302	| Customer purchase order & Customer purchase order change	| New document setting **Blank unit** for documents **Customer purchase order** and **Customer purchase order change** (Add additional item). Where the staging record will create a new sales line and the **Unit** is not provided in the file, the document setting provides options to use one of the following for the blank units: <br> • Sales unit <br> • Sales trade agreement unit <br> • Inventory unit <br> • Error (errors the complete staging record)
10436	| Customer purchase order	| New field **Comment** added to Header and line staging. Written to new EDI fields on D365 Sales order	header and lines.

**Vendor module**	

Number	| Functionality	  | Reason
:--	|:--		  |:--	
2129	| Purchase order line	| Add **Line change type** to Purchase order line EDI tab. 	
10372	| Purchase invoice	| **Product receipt quantity to match**. A Purchase invoice could be partial, i.e. not match the complete qty of the product receipt processed on D365. Previously when PackingSlipID is blank (not provided in file), EDI fully matches to the product receipt(s) processed for the order, even if Invoice qty < Product received qty. Now EDI will check staging line field ShippedQuantity, if InvoiceQuantity is less than ShippedQuantity, then 'Product receipt quantity to match' will be set to InvoiceQuantity.

**3PL module**	

Number	| Functionality	  | Reason
:--	|:--		  |:--

Reset ‘Sent to EDI’ to No which enables ‘Send to EDI’ button <br> o	**Exclude / Include** (New functionality) – Ability to exclude the record from the “outstanding” list. Use filter Excluded to view records that has been excluded and can use button Include to include record again.
