-	**Forex contract forms** - On the Action Pane, on the Forex contracts tab, in the Manage group
-	**Purchase order header** - On the Action Pane, on the Invoice tab, in the Forex contract group
-	**Purchase order lines** - On the Financials FastTab
-	**Vendor transactions** - On the Action Pane, on the Vendor tab, in the Forex contract group
