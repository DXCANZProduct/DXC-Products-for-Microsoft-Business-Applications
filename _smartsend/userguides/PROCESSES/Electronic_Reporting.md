# Electronic reporting

Smart send supports the distribution of business documents generated by Electronic Reporting.

Installed and configured ER formats can be selected from the _Report format_ column in [Smart send parameters](../CONFIGURATION/Parameters.md) When used in conjunction with SSRS it is recommended that the ER form, is set as the default report by enabling the _default_ flag in [Smart send parameters](../CONFIGURATION/Parameters.md). This will allow Smart Send to complete an Automatic ER Named Destination set-up as outlined in _Print Management_ below

## Electronic reporting destinations

To use an electronic report with print management, an electronic report destination must be created for the selected report format. Even though electronic report destinations can be used to enable multiple destinations, at least the Smart Deliver destination must be activated to deliver a document via Smart Send.

## Print Management

When the matching default report from the Smart Send Email parameters is entered into the _report format_ field as part of the Print management setup, Smart Send will generate a new ER Named Destination for the nominated form prefixed with "Smart Send" the first time the report is published, for example, Smart Send Purchase Order (Excel). This defined destination for electronic reporting can then be modified to include additional outputs, such as Screen.
