# Electronic reporting
Smart Send supports the distribution of business documents generated by Electronic Reporting. Because the ER workspace is constantly evolving, and many classes are marked as internal by Microsoft, it is advisable to conduct thorough testing before final deployment to a production environment. This is because the outcomes of some scenarios may not be as predictable with ER as they would be utilising SSRS due to Microsoft's continuous Electronic Reporting updates, Feature changes and the available combination of Electronic Reporting destination versus Electronic Reporting Named destination.   Before final deployment, this combination should be evaluated because turning on and off ER destination controls via feature management may have unexpected repercussions on both standard and ISV behaviour.

Installed and configured ER formats can be selected from the *Report format* column in [Smart send parameters](../CONFIGURATION/Parameters). When used in conjunction with SSRS, it is recommended that the ER form is set as the default report by enabling the *default* flag in [Smart send parameters](../CONFIGURATION/Parameters). This will allow Smart Send to complete an Automatic ER Named Destination set-up as outlined in *Print Management* below

## Electronic reporting destinations
To use an electronic report with print management, an electronic report destination must be created for the selected report format. Although electronic report destinations can be used to enable multiple destinations, the Smart Send destination must be activated to deliver a document via Smart Send.

## Print Management

When the matching default report from the Smart Send Email parameters is entered into the *report format* field as part of the Print management setup, Smart Send will generate a new ER Named Destination for the nominated form prefixed with "Smart Send" the first time the report is published, for example, Smart Send Purchase Order (Excel), if required.  This defined destination for electronic reporting can then be modified to include additional outputs, such as the Screen. Currently, as part of the standard D365 FSCM offering, report outputs ignore the Electronic Reporting Destination and default to the Electronic Reporting Named destination
