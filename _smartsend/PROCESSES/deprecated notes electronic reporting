# Electronic reporting
Smart send supports the distribution of business documents generated by Electronic Reporting. 

## Electronic reporting destinations
To enable an electronic report to be used via print management, an electronic report destination must be created for the selected report format. While multiple destinations can be enabled using electronic report destinations, at minimum the Smart Send destination must be enabled to send a document via Smart Send.

1. Navigate to: **Organization administration > Electronic reporting > Electronic reporting destinations**
2. Create a new electronic reporting destination record
3. Select from the *Reference* field the report format for printing
4. Create a new file destination
5. Enter a *Name*
6. Select from *File component name* the report format.
7. Select *Setting* to display available print destinations
8. Select Smart Send
9. Enable Smart Send 

## Print Management
For the newly created Electronic reporting destination to work via print management, the print management configuration needs to be reverted to the default destination. Actively defining Smart Send as a destination via printer setup will not result in a Smart Send email being generated.

1. Navigate to the appropriate *Print management* form
2. Select the report node
3. For the *Destination* select to *Revert to default printer setup*
4. For the *Report format* select the Electronic report format
