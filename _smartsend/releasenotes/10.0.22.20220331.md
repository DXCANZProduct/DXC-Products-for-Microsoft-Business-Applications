| Number | Functionality                                      | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 9654   | Override purpose                                   | Override configurations for print management are currently supported by Smart Send when using different report versions. Where the same report format is used, the email purpose used to identify the email recipient is always sourced from the default report. Print management configuration for an override condition now allows for an override purpose to be defined against the Smart Send destination. If this is entered the override purpose will supersede the purpose configured under email parameters. |
| 9713   | Key vault added for Blob storage connection string | As an alternative to the blob connection string field, users can now select to use a key vault value. This is configured on a record level under Azure blob storage setup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 9797   | Intercompany payment advice                                                                       | Smart Send did not support BankPaymAdviceVendV2.Report for the processing of payment advice for one legal entity from within another legal entity. Support for this has been added, allowing the email address to be sourced from the account in the posting company |
| 9866   | Custom versions of the updated payment advice report were not recognised by the Smart send button | The Smart Send payment advice button processes the default Smart Send configuration outside of print management. Customized versions based of BankPaymAdviceVendV2.Report were not processed. This button now supports all SSRS payment advice reports.              |
| 9947   | Sales return                                                                                      | For a sales return report to be sent successfully the user needed to have previously run the report, creating usage data. Without this, the report would error. The report will now run without the cached data.                                                     |
