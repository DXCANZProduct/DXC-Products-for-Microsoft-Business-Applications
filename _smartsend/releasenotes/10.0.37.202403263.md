| 16730  | Smart Send License error         | When users switched to the Feature management version of Smart Send they would receive an error advising the product was not licensed. This has now been corrected and users should no longer receive errors when upgrading from a non-feature-managed version of Smart Send                                                                      |
| 17433  | Report is not set for Smart Send | If a default report has not been set in the Email Parameters and more than 1 report format per report is in use Smart Send will now attempt to find the report by name.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 17623  | Error Saving to Azure Storage    | When the Company logo placeholder is used as part of an organisational email template some characters are being passed through as part of the Metadata that are not supported by Azure Blob storage. This resulted in an error being displayed referring users to LCS. This has now been updated and no Image metadata is passed through to Azure |
