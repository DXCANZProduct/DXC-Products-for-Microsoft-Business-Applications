# Upcoming framework changes

As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen our ISV product line and give the most value to our clients, Smart Send will undergo architectural modifications in a future version later this year, replacing outdated and inefficient approaches. This phase will see changes to the code structure to simplify and improve the product's overall performance. Old, out-of-date methods will be removed, and multiple-form outputs will be combined into one structure. This simplifies the procedure for future updates and/or extensions. This may impact any custom changes or extensions made to the product. Customers using the base Smart Send version are expected to remain compatible after the release. Any impacts to customers with bespoke extensions/modifications must follow their standard troubleshooting process.  The release is targeted to occur before the 10.0.44 version release Due April 2025 see [Targeted release schedule](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/get-started/public-preview-releases#targeted-release-schedule-dates-subject-to-change) to allow Customers with custom extensions/modifications to handle any impacts.

Please refer to the information in the www-authenticate header" only when using a Blob connection string | Authentication credentials are not included in the Default endpoint connection string for blob storage. When metadata is passed for an update, Azure Blob storage throws an error which is then received by smart send and thrown to the user. When using S.A.S strings the authentication credentials are included so metadata update completes successfully. Improvements were made to the DXC Connections model to update the metadata of the file during upload instead of sending metadata as a separate request. <br> DXC Connections release information - [Release notes](../CONNECTIONS/Release-notes.md) |

# Installation process

To align with MS best practice and to protect our IP the following applies to the release process.

- The license models DXCLicense and Sable37License will only be released as binaries as part of a deployable package.
- We will not provide test models for the products as binary or source code.
- We will only publish the release as a deployable package.
  We can provide model source code at our discretion. It can be requested to debug upgrade errors or if required for extensions. - If you have been given the source code to our model for extension or debugging purposes, never modify our models directly! - If you need an extension point, please send an email to ECLANZProductSupport@dxc.com and request it to be implemented.

Depending on the installation history follow one of these guides to install the new release.

## Installation without existing installed product

1. Apply the deployable package to your environment.
2. If you have requested any model for extension or debugging purposes. Install the model source code.
   a. Note, once the model source code is compiled it will overwrite the binaries installed when the deployable package was applied.

## Installation with existing installed product

If you’re installing the new release in an installation that already has a previous version of the product installed and you’re not using it for debugging or extension. We recommend that you;

1. Remove the release product model source code from your source control, if source control is used.
2. Apply the deployable package, installing the latest version of the product models as binaries.
3. Check in the binaries for the models to source control, if source control is used.

If you’re using our model source code for extension or debugging and would like to continue using it, please do the following to apply the new release with the source code.

1. Remove the product license model from your source control that applies to the release. You’ll find the license model in the deployable package. It will either be called DXCLicense or Sable37License.
2. Apply the deployable package to your environment to install the latest binaries. Check in the binaries for the license model that was removed in step 1 to source control. Note, that this step will also install the binaries for all the models in the new release.
3. Install the product release model source code and check into source control.

If you don’t follow these instructions and continue building your installation deployable package using the license model source code, the installation will continue using the same license model as before applying the release.
