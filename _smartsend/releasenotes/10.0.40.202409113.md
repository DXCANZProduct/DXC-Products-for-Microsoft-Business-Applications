19477	    | Error "Server failed to authenticate the request. Please refer to the information in the www-authenticate header" only when using a Blob connection string | Authentication credentials are not included in the Default endpoint connection string for blob storage. When metadata is passed for an update, Azure Blob storage throws an error, which is then received by Smart Send and thrown to the user. When using  S.A.S strings, the authentication credentials are included so the metadata update is complete successfully. Improvements were made to the DXC Connections model to update the metadata of the file during upload instead of sending metadata as a separate request.  <br> DXC Connections release information - [Release notes](../CONNECTIONS/Release-notes.md)
