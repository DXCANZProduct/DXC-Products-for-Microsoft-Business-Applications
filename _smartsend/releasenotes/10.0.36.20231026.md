This has been updated and centralized payment can now use Smart Send templates from multiple legal entities when making centralized vendor payments.                                                                                                                                                                         |

This has been corrected and both Free text and Customer Invoice can be issued with independent templates.                                                                                       |
| 16073  | The BankPaymAdviceVendController class has become obsolete by Microsoft in version 10.0.37 and mandatory in 10.0.34 | Smart Send now will only support BankPaymAdviceVendController V2. Activate “Enable batch processing for bank payment advice reports” via Feature management if not auto-enabled. This feature lets you use batch processing for both the customer and vendor bank payment advice reports. To use this feature, you must use BankPaymAdviceVendV2 and BankPaymAdviceCustV2 bank payment advice and set them up as the customer and vendor report formats in print management. |

| 16329  | GER payment advice - Duplicated lines and wrong recipient | When the payment journal contains two lines (two different vendors), when both are lines selected the ‘Smart send payment advice’ functionality created an email to only one vendor and it sends the other vendor’s payment advice to the wrong vendor. The settled invoices lines were also duplicated. This previously applied to customer and vendor payments and has been corrected. |

| 14961  | change to option "PRINTER DESTINATION IF NO SMART SEND RECIPIENT FOUND" | When no Smart send recipient has been selected you now have the option to set documents to not print via the renamed menu option "PRINTER DESTINATION IF NO SMART SEND RECIPIENT FOUND". This setting works in conjunction with the Save to Azure Storage options and Alternate Email in email parameters. When “do not print” is enabled documents are not routed if no recipient is found. By Default, this field is set with no option (Blank) which follows standard Smart Send logic and allows for both Azure storage or Alternate Email delivery. “Do not print” if enabled will override alternate email and Azure storage options and document will not be routed. Only occurs if no smart send recipient is found. |
