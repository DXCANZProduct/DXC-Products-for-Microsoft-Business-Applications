# Address and contact information purpose
The Smart Send feature utilizes the standard Dynamics 365 for operations concept of an [Address and contact information purpose](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/set-up-address-and-contact-information-purposes), to define which contact information record should be applicable for use with the business form or report.  You can assign multiple purposes to a single Vendor/Customer contact.  This allows operators to distribute the Smart Send form to multiple contacts simultaneously and/ or deliver Multiple forms to the same account contact automatically. 

To use the Smart Send feature at least one, ‘Address and contact information purpose,’ record should be configured for ‘Contact information’.
