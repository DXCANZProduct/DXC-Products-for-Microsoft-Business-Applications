# **Introduction**

> The DocuSign for Dynamics 365 for Operations module couples Microsoft D365 Finance and Operations with the DocuSign® solution. 

This module provides for users to be able easily send documents to various recipients (internal and external), for review, acceptance (via electronic signature) or rejection, thus making it easier for internal teams, customers, vendors and partners to do business.

All D365 Enterprise Edition documents can be sent for signature via DocuSign however the completed document (including signatures) will only be downloaded and attached via Document handling to the D365 record for the following documents: 
•	Sales Quotation – attached to the Quotation journal
•	Purchase Order Confirmation – attached to the Purchase Order confirmation journal
•	Sales Agreement Confirmation – attached to the Sales Agreement confirmation
•	Purchase Agreement Confirmation – attached to the Purchase Agreement confirmation
