However, Users, require access to the specified module/s in Finance and Operations to set up contacts as well as the document via Print management to DocuSign. 
The DocuSign Menu options are housed within Organisation ad ministration and users require access to this module to perform any set up.
The DocuSign platform has its own security protocols and permissions for users to complete set up.
