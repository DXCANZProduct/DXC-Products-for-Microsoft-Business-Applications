# 	Roadmap 

This page describes the features planned for future releases.

## Roadmap
#### Allow customised "From" emails per template
The current solution for DocuSign and Dynamics D365 facilitates one central "from" email address to be used which is coming from the DocuSign® log in. In future we hope to provide users with the ability to use multiple “from” email accounts.  This could allow large organisations that have multiple templates and documents to route certain document types such as Sales agreements, Purchase orders and Quotations back to  a centralised or shared email address within the organisation.
