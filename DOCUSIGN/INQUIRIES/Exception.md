# Metadata and Markdown template

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This Finance and Operations template contains examples of Markdown syntax, as well as guidance on setting the metadata. To get the most of it, you must view both the [raw Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/Dynamics-365-Operations/master/template.md?token=AUBjQ-wxx8wHU3pnuQiYvPdvbodbxP2uks5Ypg9_wA%3D%3D) and the [rendered view](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Dynamics-365-Operations/edit/master/template.md) (for instance, the raw Markdown shows the metadata block, while the rendered view does not).

When creating a Markdown file, you should copy this template to a new file, fill out the metadata as specified below, set the H1 heading above to the title of the article, and delete the content. 


## Metadata 

The full metadata block is above (in the [raw Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/Dynamics-365-Operations/master/template.md?token=AUBjQ-wxx8wHU3pnuQiYvPdvbodbxP2uks5Ypg9_wA%3D%3D)), divided into required fields and optional fields. **DO NOT** use a colon (:) in any of the metadata elements. 

Here are some key things to note about metadata.
