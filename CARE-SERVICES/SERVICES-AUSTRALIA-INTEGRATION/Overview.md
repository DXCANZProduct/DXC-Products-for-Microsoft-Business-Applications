# Introduction

DXC Care Services API Suite is an API integration solution for accessing Services Australia Support at Home APIs. Currently, 8 APIs are supported. For detailed information about the available APIs, please refer to the [API Reference Documentation](./API-Reference.md).  
The Support at Home program is Australia's new aged care system that began on 1 November 2025. It replaces the Home Care Packages Program and the Short-Term Restorative Care Programme. Its purpose is to help older Australians stay independent in their own homes and communities for longer.

The API integration offers several key advantages:

- **Seamless data access**: Pull data directly from Services Australia's system securely through API connections
- **Secure updates**: Update data within Services Australia's system using secure, certified connections
- **Certified solution**: Our solution is certified by Services Australia for all available APIs
- **Ready-to-use integration**: Customers can utilize this solution for their own integration needs without building from scratch
- **Reliable authentication**: Leverage our PRODA authentication and API certification for reliable data access and connectivity
- **Reduced implementation effort**: Avoid the complexity and time investment of implementing your own integration solution
