# Funding

-   Transactions related to funding will not appear in the Customer transactions form because they are not related to the customer balance.
-   Funding claims for Community and Disability service providers can be imported via the data migration framework.
-   The funding claims for residential Care services providers will be generated from the residents’ funding schedules.
-   The Funding claim form will group all relevant funding claims to generate the funding claim file.
