### Reversing an accommodation payment refund

This process is used to reverse the full refund when a resident has been departed from the service entry. The full refund has been generated, to the point of the refund journal being posted to AP, but not yet paid to the client or their estate.

As the Accommodation Payment has already been fully refunded and cannot be refunded again there needs to be a new Accommodation payment header setup to enable the refund to be processed again later when it is ready

This process will:  
\- reset the accommodation payment record and the liability account  
\- allow the Interest payable to be generated on the new accommodation payment and   
\- allow the new accommodation payment to be refunded when ready.

**Path: Care services \> All customers \> Care services \> Service entries**
