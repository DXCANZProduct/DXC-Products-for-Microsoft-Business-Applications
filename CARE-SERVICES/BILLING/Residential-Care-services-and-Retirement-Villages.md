# Residential Care Services and Retirement Villages
Manual journals can be entered or imported into the system.
-   Journals can be generated from the billing schedules by running the Billing journal proposal. The proposal utilises the Billing schedule to automatically generate transactions up to the selected end date.
-   Fees can be split to be paid by different parties, such as family members or third-party organisations.

### Billing journal proposals

Navigate to: **Care services >  Billing > Journals > Billing journal**

-   The billing journal proposal end date controls the billing being generated.
-   If the client has not been billed before, then the billing will be generated from the start day on the billing schedule to the end date on the billing proposal.
-   If the client has been billed before, then there will be a ‘Last run date’ on the billing schedule line. The billing proposal will generate fees from the day after the ‘Last run date’ to the end date on the billing proposal.

-   There are multiple billing proposal options:

|  **Propposal Type**  | **Description** | 
|:---|:---|   
| **Billing journal proposal**|used to generate billing up to a specified date for a specified client(s) or service(s) from the billing schedule lines.|
|    **Consolidate journal lines**|used to combine lines when there are multiple journal lines in the same journal for the same customer, billing code & service code.|
|    **Billing journal adjustment proposal**|used to propose adjustments where there has been a change, such as a Departure or a rate change, that requires billing to be reversed and re-charged.|
|    **Accommodation payment proposal**|used to charge unpaid interest and DAPs or DACs related to an accommodation payment.|
|    **Interest payable to client proposal**|used to calculate interest payable to a departed client with an accommodation payment that has not yet been refunded.|
|    **DMF/CRF proposal** |used to charge the deferred management and capital refurbishment fees for a retirement living lump sum payment.|
|    **Exceeded leave adjustment proposal**|used to calculate any fees due to leave taken exceeding the Department of Health caps.|

### Billing journal adjustment proposal

Billing adjustments are run whenever a client has billing that is required to be reversed and possibly re-billed. Examples of this are when a client:

-   has been billed in advance, and then the rate has been changed.
-   has been billed in advance and then departs.
-   has been billed in advance, and after payment of the accommodation payment lump sum, requests for fees to be drawn down instead.

Navigate to: **Care services >  Billing > Journals > Billing journal > Lines**

1.  Go to **Billing proposal options**.
2.  Select **Billing journal adjustment proposal**
3.  Populate the journal posting date.
4.  Populate the end date.
5.  Select ‘Include departed clients’ or ‘Departed clients only’ if required.
6.  If required, filter on Advance or Arrears so that billing can be generated only for billing codes with advance or arrears selected on the billing code configuration.
7.  Click on **Filter**
8.  Specify the required criteria for generating the billing journals (customer account, Service code, billing code)
9.  Click **OK**
10. *If required, set up the job to run in the background. Select Batch processing to Yes*
11. *Click on Recurrence*
12. *The default value is for the job to run once (End after:1). If it is a requirement for the job to run at a regular interval, then set up the required recurrence pattern.*
13. *Click OK to close the Recurrence form.*
14. *Click OK to add the job to the batch queue.*
15. The total fee billed in advance will be reversed.
    There will be two new lines proposed.
    - One line will be for the relevant days on the old billing rate.
    - The second line will be for the relevant days on the new billing rate.

### Billing Capping Limits

-   Capping limits are the amounts specified by the government as the maximum annual or lifetime amount that can be charged of a particular type of fee, such as means-tested fees or income-tested fees.
-   If the *allow charge beyond capping limits* is set to yes, then the billing will continue even if the cap has been reached.
-   When the parameter is set to No, the billing will end when the capping limit has been reached.
-   Prior to generating the billing journal, ensure the capping limit setup has been completed for the client (Path: **Care services > All Customers > Set up > Capping limits setup** )
-   The client capping calculation periodic job updates the client capping limit setup after posting the journal.
