# Freight forwarder landed cost setup
## Trading partners

EDI works on the basis that an external entity (trading partner) wants to send or receive information from us. To this end, the module is built to link the documents and their associated settings to those entities (trading partners).
A trading partner can be created based on an existing D365 entity like a warehouse, vendor or a customer. Depending on the various modules installed, different trading partner types will be available for setup.
It also provides the setup for trading partner level options as well as defining which incoming and outgoing document types are enabled for the trading partner.

To open the **Trading partners** page, go to **EDI > Setup > Trading partners**. Then set the fields as described in the following subsections.

### All trading partners
The [Core trading partner setup](../../CORE/Setup/Trading%20partners.md) describes the setup applicable to **All** types of trading partners.
