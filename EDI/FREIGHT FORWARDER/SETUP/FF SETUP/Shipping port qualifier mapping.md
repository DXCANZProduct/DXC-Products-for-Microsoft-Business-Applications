# Freight forwarder setup
## Setup Shipping port qualifier mapping

Users can access the form by navigating to **EDI > Setup > Freight forwarder landed cost setup > Shipping port qualifier mapping**

Used to map the Freight forwarderâ€™s shipping port qualifier value to indicate if the port referred to in the message is the **From port** or **To port**.
If the voyage tracking leg, whose tracking is being updated, includes a From and To port (Example: Air or Sea legs), the **Shipping port mapping** and **Shipping port qualifier** will be used to find the applicable leg to update. This is especially useful for journeys with multiple sea and/or air legs.

-	In the **Name** field, enter the name of the Shipping port qualifier mapping group
-	In the **Description** field, enter a description of the Shipping port qualifier mapping group
-	In the **Mappings** FastTab, select **Add** to create a new record
-	Select the **Shipping port qualifier** from the available list. Options include: 
    - From port
    - To port	
-	Specify the Freight forwarder's **Value**. Blank is allowed.
