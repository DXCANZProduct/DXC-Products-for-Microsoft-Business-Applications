# Vendor setup
## Vendor document type validation profiles - Purchase invoice

Users can access the form by navigating to **EDI > Setup > Document types**.

Validation profiles are groups of business validation rules that can be applied to a trading partner. They provide the ability to set variable tolerances on various different aspects of the documents business process. Once a validation profile is created it can be configured by adding validation rules to it and defining the error tolerance of the rule. <br>
Once setup for each document type, the validation profile can be assigned to each incoming document on the Trading partner setup in **EDI > Setup > Trading partners**.
