# Vendor purchase order acknowledgement

Companies may require a vendor to send a purchase order acknowledgement (POA) for an order and can be one of the reasons a purchase order status is 'In external review'. <br> Where the [Vendor purchase order document setting profile](../SETUP/SETTING-PROFILES/Vendor-purchase-order.md) **Acknowledgement required** is set to _Yes_, the purchase order status will be set to **In external review** upon confirmation.

The following subsections will describe how to view, process the acknowledgement and send a Vendor purchase order confirmation (if required). <br>
The Acknowledgement can be viewed from the [Purchase order](#purchase-order) and confirmation values will be populated with default values per Trading partner.<br>
The Confirmation can be either [manually](#manually-processing-purchase-order-acknowledgement) processed or [automatically](#automatically-processing-purchase-order-acknowledgement). <br>
Viewing the [Staging table records](#view-staging-table-records) will also be discussed.
The processed purchase order acknowledgement and sent confirmation record(s) can be viewed for a purchase order, by selecting the **History** button on the **EDI** tab on the Action Pane of the Purchase order page.<br>

## Prerequisites
The following setup is prerequisites for the vendor purchase order acknowledgement

1. Create [POA response code groups](../SETUP/VENDOR-SETUP/POA-response-code-group.md) to map the vendor's values to EDI POA responses code groups.
1. Create [Template](../../CORE/Setup/DocumentTypes/File-templates.md) for the document.
1. Create [Setting profile](../SETUP/SETTING-PROFILES/Vendor-purchase-order-acknowledgement.md) for the document.
1. Create [Validation profile](../SETUP/VALIDATION-PROFILES/Vendor-purchase-order-acknowledgement.md) for the document.
1. If the vendor [trading partner](../SETUP/Trading-partner.md) doesn't exist, create the new trading partner.
1. Assign the applicable POA response code group to the vendor trading partner.
1. Add and enable the vendor purchase order acknowledgement document to the [Vendor trading partner](../SETUP/Trading-partner.md) and select the applicable:
    - Template
    - Setting profile
    - Validation profile
    - Search mask

## Processing
Inbound files have the following three steps:
1. **Import** - Imported file can be viewed in **EDI > Files > Inbound files**
2. **Import to staging** - Imported file is processed to staging record/s. The staging record/s can be viewed at **EDI > Documents > Vendor documents > Vendor purchase order acknowledgement**
3. **Staging to target** - The staging record/s is processed to target. If the acknowledgement is succefully processed the corresponding D365 purchase can be updated as per the received vendor values

### Create document
![alt text](../../CORE/Image/Create_Document.png "Create document")

### Header checks for Vendor purchase order acknowledgement
Header checks are performed when:
1. Importing Vendor purchase order acknowledgement file
2. Processing from import to staging
3. Processing from staging to target


![alt text](../IMAGE/HeaderChecks_VendorPOA.png "Header checks for Vendor purchase order acknowledgement")

### Step 1 - Import
When a purchase order acknowledgement file is imported, the file name is key to identifying the vendor and therefore the document template. See [Trading partners](../../CORE/Setup/Trading-partners.md) for further details.  It is based on this document template that the data within the file is identified and a record created in the EDI staging table in the next step.

> Note: The file mask is used to identify the trading partner and therefore template

### Step 2 - Import to staging - Inbound file validation
When the purchase order acknowledgement file is retrieved and imported, there are various validations that are completed before the staging record is created in the EDI staging table.
If the processing of **Import to staging** errors, the Inbound file's **Status** will be set to _Error_ and no staging record created.

**Rule Id**         |	**Details**         
:--                 |:--                  
**Check Template**  |	Identify a template for the Vendor/Document type. This will be used to identify the whereabouts of data within the file

#### Possible issues and fixes
**Import to staging** errors for Vendor purchase order acknowledgements can be viewed in:
- **EDI > Files > Inbound files** filtered to **Status** set to _Error_
- **EDI > Document maintenance**, tab **Vendor documents**, tile **File import errors**

At this step the issues are usually around the file not matching the template.
- Does the file have the correct template assigned (General tab, field **Template**):
  - **No**: Use **Reset template** to assign a different template. If this should apply to future documents for the Trading partner, also update in **Trading partners**.
  - **Yes**: Review **Log** and fix the applicable template in **EDI > Setup > Document types**. Examples issues are date format, new field.

Example error for file not matching template: 'Segment '<xml' not found in EDI template mapping'

### Step 3 - Staging to target
If the processing of **Staging to target** errors, the staging record's **Staging to target status** will be set to _Error_ and the acknowledgement won't be created on the target D365 purchase order.

#### Staging line validation - Purchase order acknowledgement

![alt text](../IMAGE/LineChecks_VendorPOA.png "Item checks for Vendor purchase order acknowledgement")

**Rule Id**                 | **Details**                                               | Error    
:---                        |:---                                                       |:---              
**PO line number**          | Find the D365 purchase order line number to which the POA line belongs    | Error at Staging table. <br> No target POA created
**No Valid Item**           | No valid item based on the different options available    | Error at Staging table. <br> No target POA created

#### Possible issues and fixes
**Staging to target** errors for Vendor purchase order acknowledgements can be viewed in:
- **EDI > Documents > Vendor documents > Vendor purchase order acknowledgement** filtered to **Staging to target tatus** set to _Error_
- **EDI > Document maintenance**, tab **Vendor documents**, tile **Purchase order acknowledgement errors**
- **EDI > Document maintenance**, tab **Vendor documents**, **Documents** page, tab **POA**

At this step the issues are usually around mapping/business logic issues. <br> 
Review the **Log** or **Version log** for the applicable record to find the issue. Example errors and method to fix are discussed in below table. <br>
Example errors and possible fixes are discussed in [FAQ](../INTRODUCTION/FAQ.md#vendor-purchase-order-acknowledgement)

### Validation

[Validation profiles](../SETUP/VALIDATION-PROFILES/Vendor-purchase-order-acknowledgement.md) can be specified and linked to the template along with a rule error tolerance which is used to determine how D365 will react.  Options are:
-	**Info** - An infolog is displayed with information only, it is not identified as a warning
-	**Warning** - An infolog is displayed with a warning. It is possible to carry on processing
-	**Error** - An infolog is displayed with an error. It is not possible to carry on processing until the error has been corrected. EDI Status = Error

The following table describes each validation option for the Vendor purchase order akcnowledgement document. It also describes if the validation rule is not met, but only has an info or warning error tolerance, how the target D365 purchase order will be updated.

Rule Id	                | Details	                            | Info/Warning tolerance updates
:--                     |:--                                    |:--
<ins>**Purchase order header**</ins>    |
**Reject**              | Vendor POA response: **Header – not accepted**. Vendor rejects the complete purchase order. <br> This validation can be used to manually manage Vendor rejections by adding this validation with an error tolerance.	| Cancel purchase order
**Version**             | Validates that the vendor is responding to the current purchase order version	          | No update to D365 PO, only used for comparison
**Delivery date**       | Vendor POA response: **Header – change**. <br> The Vendor’s POA delivery date doesn’t match the D365 PO's delivery date	| Update PO header's **Confirmed delivery date**
**Vendor reference**    | Vendor POA’s Vendor reference doesn’t match the PO’s Vendor reference	                  | Update PO header's **Vendor reference**
<ins>**Purchase order line**</ins>  |
**Short pick**          | Vendor POA response: **Line shipment - partial**. <br> Acknowledgement qty is less than purchase order line qty. If the vendor’s unit differs, unit conversion is used to convert. | Update PO line's deliver remainder qty (use unit conversion if POA different unit).
**Batch Id update**     | Where the batch id received is different to the batch id on the purchase order.	| If batch doesn’t exist for item, the batch is created and assigned to the purchase order line
**Purchase price**      | Vendor POA response: **Line price advise**. <br> The vendor’s POA unit price should be checked using the purchase order unit price. <br> If the prices are slightly different it should check both the tolerance and ‘Use Vendor Price’ flag before giving an error/warning. Example: <br> Item X purchase order unit price 10.25 <br> Item Y purchase order unit price 8.88 <br> Vendor has a min and max tolerance setting of 0.05 <br> Purchase order prices are not including tax <br> Vendor sends their EDI POA including tax <br> The setting use vendor pricing is given <br> Item X EDI file price (before converting) 11.26 (after conversion) 10.24 <br> Item Y EDI file price (before converting) 9.70 (after conversion) 8.82. <br> Template setting against this field is warning. <br> A warning is only given for Item Y because it is outside of the tolerance. 	| Update PO line's purchase price (if within allowed variance): else error
**Delivery date**       | The Vendor’s POA line delivery date doesn’t match the PO delivery date	    | Update PO line confirmed delivery date
**Reject**              | Vendor POA response: **Line item – out of stock** <br> Vendor POA response: **Line item – withdrawn** <br> Vendor rejects the purchase order line	| Cancel purchase order line’s deliver remainder
**Minimum/maximum quantity**    | The POA quantity should be devisable by the multiple specified on the Default/Site order settings table. <br> Use unit conversion if POA unit of measurement differs. Need to set to Error if not allowed to increase deliver remainder over purchase order line over-delivery%	| Update PO line deliver remainder. 
**Line item added**     | The POA contains a new line for the purchase order. <br> Example: another line is cancelled and replaced with this new line. | Add new line to D365 PO

#### Override error validation

Where a Vendor purchase order acknowledgement staging record has errored because of Error tolerance validation, button **Override error validation** can be used to override and process to target. <br>

The button is available on:
- EDI > Vendor workspaces > EDI purchase order processing. Select the Validation tab and select **POA Errors** under Processing or the tile under Summary.
- EDI > Documents > Vendor documents > Vendor purchase order acknowledgement. Button is enabled when status is not completed or canceled.

## Purchase order
Users can access **All purchase orders** page by navigating to **Accounts payable > Purchase orders > All purchase orders** and manage the EDI POA's Confirmation details by using the below buttons that have been added to the **EDI** tab on the Action Pane.

Field	                  | Description
:--                       |:--
**Confirmation**          |	Select the **Confirmation** button to review vendor's POA for the D365 PO. The details of this page will be discussed in below.
**Send to EDI**           |	Select the **Send to EDI** button to create Purchase Order Confirmation (POC) staging table record. The button will only be available if a POA has been received from the Vendor.
**Reset flag**            |	Select the **Reset flag** button to reset the **EDI status** to allow for re-sending of the POC to the staging table. Note: The POC record on the staging table should be deleted manually before the sales order flag is reset.

## Processing Purchase order confirmation (POC)
The POC can be sent [manually](#manually-processing-purchase-order-confirmation) or [automatically](#automatically-processing-purchase-order-confirmation) to the vendor.
Both of these options will be discussed in the following subsections.

### Manually processing Purchase order confirmation
The **Confirmation** page is accessed by navigating to **Accounts payable > Purchase orders > All purchase orders**, and selecting **Confirmation** on the **EDI** tab on the Action Pane.
A list of outstanding confirmations can also be accessed by navigating to **EDI > Vendor workspaces > EDI purchase order processing** and either selecting the tile or tab called **Pending POA confirm**.

The Confirmation page is split into five tabs:
1. [Header](#header) - Manage the POC header's response for ship and receipt dates. 
3. [Line price](#line-price) - Manage the POC line' price response, example vendor's POA purchase price vs. D365 PO line system price. 
4. [Line quantity](#line-quantity) - Manage the POC line quantity response, example vendor's POA purchase quantity vs. D365 PO line quantity.
5. [Line date](#line-date) - Manage the POC line date response, example vendor's POA acknowledged delivery date vs. D365 PO line's requested delivery date. Used to update PO line's confirmed delivery date.
6. [Line pack](#line-pack) - Manage the POC line pack response, example Vendor pack vs. System pack
7. [Line inner](#line-inner) - Manage the POC line inner response, example Vendor inner vs. System inner

Vendor mapped values for POA response codes are setup in [POA response code group](../SETUP/VENDOR-SETUP/POA-response-code-group.md) and assigned to the Vendor trading partner's **POA response code group**.

### Automatically processing Purchase order confirmation

Vendor EDI module includes the ability to automatically send vendor purchase confirmations by setting **Purchase order confirmation required** to _Yes (PO is auto-confirmed)_ on the [Vendor purchase order acknowledgement](../SETUP/SETTING-PROFILES/Vendor-purchase-order-acknowledgement.md) document setting and assigning it to the Vendor trading partner on the incoming document **Vendor purchase order acknowledgement** (POA). Once a POA is received from the Vendor, EDI will use document settings and validation to automatically send a confirmation to the vendor. <br>
The confirmations can be viewed in:
- **History** tab on the D365 Purchase order Action Pane, EDI tab. If **Reference** is set to _Confirmation_, the Confirmation matched the Vendor's POA. If set to _Change_, the Confirmation didn't match and sent a change to the vendor.
- **EDI > Documents > Vendor purchase order change**. If **EDI order purpose** is set to mapped value for _Confirmation_, the Confirmation matched the Vendor's POA. If set to mapped value for _Change_, the Confirmation didn't match and sent a change to the vendor.

## View staging table records
To view the Vendor purchase order acknowledgement staging records, go to **EDI > Documents > Vendor documents > Vendor purchase order acknowledgement**. 
Use this page to review staging and process EDI Vendor purchase order acknowledgement documents, update the D366 purchase order and send the purchase order confirmation (where set to automatic).

### List page
