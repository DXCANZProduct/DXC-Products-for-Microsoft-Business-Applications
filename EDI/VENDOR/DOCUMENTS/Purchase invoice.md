# Purchase invoice

EDI vendors can send a purchase invoice for one or multiple purchase orders. <br>
An EDI purchase invoice can be received and processed for D365 purchase orders not sent to the vendor via EDI.
The following subsections will describe how to view and process the invoice for purchase orders. <br>

Based on [document settings](../SETUP/SETTING%20PROFILES/Purchase%20invoice.md), the EDI purchase invoice can either:
- Create a pending purchase order invoice where the match status fails
- Post the purchase order invoice if match status passes, or
- Submit pending purchase order invoice to workflow

Viewing the [Staging table records](#view-staging-table-records) will also be discussed. <br> 
The processed EDI purchase invoice record(s) can be viewed for a purchase order, by selecting the **History** button on the **EDI** tab on the Action Pane of the Purchase order page.<br>

## Prerequisites
The following setup is prerequisites for the purchase invoice:

1. Create [Charges code](../SETUP/VENDOR%20SETUP/Charges%20code.md) to map the vendor's values to D365 Charges codes.
2. Create [Payment terms type group](../SETUP/VENDOR%20SETUP/Payment%20terms%20type%20group.md) to map the vendor's values to D365 Payment terms.
3. Create [Misc charge/allowance indicator](../SETUP/VENDOR%20SETUP/Misc%20charge%20allowance%20indicator.md) to map the vendor's values to EDI Indicator.
4. Create [Misc method of handling](../SETUP/VENDOR%20SETUP/Misc%20method%20of%20handling.md) to map the vendor's values to EDI Method of handling.
5. Create [Template](../../CORE/Setup/DocumentTypes/File%20templates.md) for the document.
6. Create [Setting profile](../SETUP/SETTING%20PROFILES/Purchase%20invoice.md) for the document.
7. Create [Validation profile](../SETUP/VALIDATION%20PROFILES/Purchase%20invoice.md) for the document.
8. If the vendor [trading partner](../SETUP/Trading%20partner.md) doesn't exist, create the new trading partner.
9. Assign the applicable Charges code, Payment terms type group, Misc charge/allowance indicator and Misc method of handling to the vendor trading partner.
10. Add and enable the purchase invoice document to the [Vendor trading partner](../SETUP/Trading%20partner.md) and select the applicable:
    - Template
    - Setting profile
    - Validation profile
    - Search mask

## Processing
Inbound files have the following three steps:
1. **Import** - Imported file can be viewed in **EDI > Files > Inbound files**
2. **Import to staging** - Imported file is processed to staging record/s. The staging record/s can be viewed at **EDI > Documents > Vendor documents > Purchase invoice**
3. **Staging to target** - The staging record/s is processed to target. If the invoice is succefully processed a target D365 Purchase order invoice (pending, posted or submitted to workflow) will be created for the purchase order(s).

### Create document
![alt text](../../CORE/Image/Create_Document.png "Create document")

### Header checks for Purchase invoice
Header checks are performed when:
1. Importing Purchase invoice file
2. Processing from import to staging
3. Processing from staging to target

![alt text](../IMAGE/HeaderChecks_PurchaseInvoice.png "Header checks for Purchase invoice")

## Step 1 - Import
When a purchase invoice file is imported, the file name is key to identifying the vendor and therefore the document template. See [Trading partners](../../CORE/Setup/Trading%20partners.md) for further details.  It is based on this document template that the data within the file is identified and a record created in the EDI staging table in the next step.

> Note: The file mask is used to identify the trading partner and therefore template

## Step 2 - Import to staging - Inbound file validation
When the purchase invoice file is retrieved and imported, there are various validations that are completed before the staging record is created in the EDI staging table.
If the processing of **Import to staging** errors, the Inbound file's **Status** will be set to _Error_ and no staging record created.

**Rule Id**         |	**Details**         
:--                 |:--                  
**Check Template**  |	Identify a template for the Vendor/Document type. This will be used to identify the whereabouts of data within the file

#### Possible issues and fixes
**Import to staging** errors for Purchase invoice can be viewed in:
- **EDI > Files > Inbound files** filtered to **Status** set to _Error_
- **EDI > Document maintenance**, tab **Vendor documents**, tile **File import errors**

At this step the issues are usually around the file not matching the template.
- Does the file have the correct template assigned (General tab, field **Template**):
  - **No**: Use **Reset template** to assign a different template. If this should apply to future documents for the Trading partner, also update in **Trading partners**.
  - **Yes**: Review **Log** and fix the applicable template in **EDI > Setup > Document types**. Examples issues are date format, new field.

Example error for file not matching template: 'Segment '<xml' not found in EDI template mapping'

## Step 3 - Staging to target
If the processing of **Staging to target** errors, the staging record's **Staging to target status** will be set to _Error_ and the D365 purchase order invoice won't be created.

#### Possible issues and fixes
**Staging to target** errors for Purchase invoice can be viewed in:
- **EDI > Documents > Vendor documents > Purchase invoice** filtered to **Staging to target tatus** set to _Error_
- **EDI > Document maintenance**, tab **Vendor documents**, tile **Purchase invoice errors**
- **EDI > Document maintenance**, tab **Vendor documents**, **Documents** page, tab **Invoice**

At this step the issues are usually around mapping/business logic issues. <br> 
Review the **Log** or **Version log** for the applicable record to find the issue. Example errors and method to fix are discussed in below table. <br>
Example errors and possible fixes are discussed in [FAQ](../OTHER/FAQ.md#purchase-invoice)

### Staging line validation - Purchase invoice

![alt text](../IMAGE/LineChecks_PurchaseInvoice.png "Item checks for Purchase invoice")

**Rule Id**                 | **Details**                                                   | Error    
:---                        |:---                                                           |:---              
**PO number**               | Find the D365 PO number to which the invoice belongs          | Error at Staging table.  <br> No pending D365 invoice created
**PO line number**          | Find the D365 purchase order line number to which the invoice line belongs    | Error at Staging table. <br> No D365 invoice created
**No Valid Item**           | No valid item based on the different options available        | Error at Staging table. <br> No D365 invoice created


### Validation

[Validation profiles](../SETUP/VALIDATION%20PROFILES/Purchase%20invoice.md) can be specified and linked to the template along with a rule error tolerance which is used to determine how D365 will react.  Options are:
-	**Info** - An infolog is displayed with information only, it is not identified as a warning
-	**Warning** - An infolog is displayed with a warning. It is possible to carry on processing
-	**Error** - An infolog is displayed with an error. It is not possible to carry on processing until the error has been corrected. EDI Status = Error

The following table describes each validation option for the Purchase invoice document. It also describes if the validation rule is not met, but only has an info or warning error tolerance, how D365 will react.

Rule Id	                | Details	                            | Info/Warning tolerance updates
:--                     |:--                                    |:--
