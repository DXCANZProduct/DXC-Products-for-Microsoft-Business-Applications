# Process Overview

## Purchase order, acknowledgement and confirmation process overview
The Trading partner or VAN will place data into a ‘cloud accessible’ location (i.e. FTP, SFTP or Azure blob) and D365 will periodically import these files into an inbound document staging area for processing.

D365 will use templates to read the data from the inbound documents and create staging data. The staging data is then processed into target documents within D365 and standard application processing rules are applied.
