# Sales invoice
EDI customers may require a Sales invoice for a sales order.

> Note: Sales invoices can also be sent for a sales order not created via EDI.

The following subsections will describe how to view, process and send Sales invoices to applicable Customer Trading partners. <br>
Viewing the [Staging table records](#view-staging-table-records) will also be discussed. <br>
The created sales invoice record(s) can be viewed for a sales order, by selecting the **History** button on the **EDI** tab on the Action Pane of the Sales order page.<br>

## Prerequisites
The following setup is prerequisites for the sales invoice

1. Create [Template](../../CORE/Setup/DocumentTypes/File-templates.md) for the document.
2. Create [Setting profile](../SETUP/SETTING-PROFILES/Sales-invoice.md) for the document.
3. Create [Outbound filenames](../../CORE/Setup/DocumentTypes/Outbound-filenames.md) for the document.
4. If the customer [trading partner](../SETUP/Trading-partner.md) doesn't exist, create the new trading partner.
5. Add and enable the sales invoice to the [Customer trading partner](../SETUP/Trading-partner.md) and select the applicable:
    - Template
    - Setting profile
