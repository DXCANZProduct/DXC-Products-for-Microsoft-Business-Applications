# Customer advanced shipping notice (ASN)

EDI customers may require an advanced shipping notice (ASN) for a sales order.

> Note: Customer advanced shipping notice can also be sent for a sales order not created via EDI, where document setting 'Send only for EDI orders' allows it.

The following subsections will describe how to view, process and send Customer advanced shipping notice to applicable Customer Trading partners. <br>
Viewing the [Staging table records](#view-staging-table-records) will also be discussed. <br>
The created ASN record(s) can be viewed for a sales order, by selecting the **History** button on the **EDI** tab on the Action Pane of the Sales order page.<br>

## Prerequisites
The following setup is prerequisites for the customer advanced shipping notice

1. Create [Template](../../CORE/Setup/DocumentTypes/File-templates.md) for the document.
2. Create [Setting profile](../SETUP/SETTING-PROFILES/Customer-advanced-shipping-notice.md) for the document.
3. Create [Outbound filenames](../../CORE/Setup/DocumentTypes/Outbound-filenames.md) for the document.
4. If the customer [trading partner](../SETUP/Trading-partner.md) doesn't exist, create the new trading partner.
5. Add and enable the customer advanced shipping notice to the [Customer trading partner](../SETUP/Trading-partner.md) and select the applicable:
    - Template
    - Setting profile
    - File name setup
6. Assign [ASN line configuration](../SETUP/Warehouses.md) to all the 'ship from' warehouses.

## Processing

### Post packing slip
When posting a packing slip for a sales order, it is possible to add consignment information.
-	From the packing slip posting form, select the **Assign consignment note** button
-	To create a new consignment note record, select **New**
    - Update the **Consignment note number**
    - Select the **Shipping carrier** and **Carrier service**
-	To select a previously created consignment note, select the record
> Note: Consignment notes will be matched to the delivery based on the Delivery Name, Delivery address, Customer account and warehouse.
-	Click **Assign** to attach the consignment note number to the packing slip
-	**Send to EDI**: Where the **ASN strategy** has been configured to:
    - **Single packing slip**, the Send to EDI flag will be set to _Yes_.  Once the packing slip is posted, a Customer advanced shipping notice record will be created in the staging table.
    - **Consolidated packing slip**, the Send to EDI flag will be set to _No_. Users still need to assign the Consignment note, but the ASN must be sent to EDI from the [Consignment notes](#consignment-notes) page before a Customer advanced shipping notice staging record will be created.

> Note: **ASN strategy** is setup on the [Customer advanced shipping notice setting profile](../SETUP/SETTING-PROFILES/Customer-advanced-shipping-notice.md)
and assigned to the Trading partner when setting up the document on their outgoing documents. 

> Note: If the packing slip was posted without assigning a consignment note, it is possible to [add the packing slip](#add-packing-slips-to-a-consignment-note) to a consignment note afterwards.
> The Customer advanced shipping notice setting profile, has the option to **Warn when consignment note not assigned**.

### Consignment notes
EDI requires the delivery to be assigned to a consignment note. The consignment note can contain one or multiple deliveries.
The consignment note can be created when posting the packing slip, or by following the steps as per following subsection.

#### Create a consignment note
To open the **Consignment notes** page, go to **EDI > Inquiries and reports > Consignment notes**.
-	To create a new consignment note, select **New**
-	Select the **Customer account** for the consignment
-	Enter the **Consignment note number**
-	Select the **Shipping carrier** and **Carrier service**
-	Select the **Delivery address information**

#### Add packing slips to a consignment note
To open the **Consignment notes** page, go to **EDI > Inquiries and reports > Consignment notes**. 
-	Select the applicable consignment note
-	To add packing slips, select **Add** from the consignment lines
-	A list of unassigned packing slips for the customer and delivery address will be displayed
-	Select valid record(s) to be assigned to the consignment note
-	Select **Add lines**

#### Create ASN staging record from consignment notes
To open the **Consignment notes** page, go to **EDI > Inquiries and reports > Consignment notes**. 
-	Select the applicable consignment note
-	Select **Send to EDI** to send all consignment information to the Customer advanced shipping notice staging (ASN) table
-	If required, select **Reset flag** to update the consignment and resend the ASN. The ASN record should be deleted in the staging page and outbound files before the flag is reset.


#### Auto generate a consignment note number
The shipping carriers page has an additional option located on the EDI FastTab to enable users to **Auto generate consignment note Id**.  Where this parameter is set to Yes, the **Pro number sequence** must also be set.

To enable the consignment note to be auto generated, the following criteria must be met:
-	**Carrier** must be specified on the sales order
-	**Carrier** must be specified on the Picklist or WHS shipment
-	**ASN strategy** must be _Single packing slip_
-	The packing slip must be posted from the **Pick list registration** or the **WHS Shipment**
