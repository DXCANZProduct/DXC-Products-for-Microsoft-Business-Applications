# Voyage creator

The following subsections will describe how to view and process the **Voyage creator** from the Freight forwarder. <br>
Viewing the [Staging table records](#view-staging-table-records) will also be discussed.

Processing this document adds the relevant purchase and/or transfer orders to an existing open Voyage (if document setting allows) or create new Voyage(s). <br>

## Prerequisites
The following setup is prerequisites for the **Voyage creator**

### Freight forwarder landed cost setup
EDI > Setup > Freight forwarder landed cost setup <br>
Where the Freight forwarder's values differ to D365/EDI values - use the following mappings for the Voyage creator:
1. Create [Shipping port mapping](../SETUP/FF-SETUP/Shipping-port-mapping.md) to map the Trading partner's values to D365 Landed cost shipping port.
2. Create [Modes of delivery mapping](../SETUP/FF-SETUP/Modes-of-delivery-mapping.md) to map the Trading partner's values to D365 Modes of delivery.
3. Create [Customs broker mapping](../SETUP/FF-SETUP/Customs-broker-mapping.md) to map the Trading partner's values to D365 Vendor of Shipping type set to _Customs broker_.
4. Create [Shipping container types mapping](../SETUP/FF-SETUP/Shipping-container-types-mapping.md) to map the Trading partner's values to D365 Landed cost shipping conntainer types.
5. Create [Shipping measurement unit mapping](../SETUP/FF-SETUP/Shipping-measurement-unit-mapping.md) to map the Trading partner's values to D365 Landed cost shipping measurement units.

### Document type setup
EDI > Setup > Document types: Voyage creator
1. Create [Template](../../CORE/Setup/DocumentTypes/File-templates.md) for the document.
1. Create [Setting profile](../SETUP/SETTING-PROFILES/Voyage-creator.md) for the document.

### Trading partners
EDI > Setup > Trading partners
1. If the Freight forwarder landed cost [trading partner](../SETUP/Trading-partner.md) doesn't exist, create the new trading partner.
1. Assign the Freight forwarder landed cost setup to the trading partner's options:
    -  Shipping port mapping: Options from **EDI > Setup > Freight forwarder landed cost setup > Shipping port mapping**
    -  Modes of delivery mapping: Options from **EDI > Setup > Freight forwarder landed cost setup > Modes of delivery mapping**
    -  Customs broker mapping: Options from **EDI > Setup > Freight forwarder landed cost setup > Customs broker mapping**
    -  Shipping container types mapping: Options from **EDI > Setup > Freight forwarder landed cost setup > Shipping container types mapping**
    -  Shipping measurement unit mapping: Options from **EDI > Setup > Freight forwarder landed cost setup > Shipping measurement unit mapping**
1. Add and enable the **Voyage creator** document to the [Freight forwarder landed cost trading partner](../SETUP/Trading-partner.md) and select the applicable:
    - Template
    - Setting profile
    - Search mask

## Processing
Inbound files have the following three steps:
1. **Import** - Imported file can be viewed in **EDI > Files > Inbound files**.
2. **Import to staging** - Imported file is processed to staging record/s. The staging record/s can be viewed at **EDI > Documents > Freight forwarder landed cost documents > Voyage creator**.
3. **Staging to target** - The staging record/s is processed to target. If the Voyage creator is succefully processed the relevent D365 purchase and/or transfer orders will be added to an existing open Voyage (if document setting allows) or create a new Voyage.

### Create document
![alt text](../../CORE/Image/Create_Document.png "Create document")

### Header checks for Voyage creator
Header checks are performed when:
1. Importing Voyage creator file
2. Processing from import to staging
3. Processing from staging to target

![alt text](../IMAGE/HeaderChecks_FFVoyageCreator.png "Header checks for Voyage creator")

### Step 1 - Import
When an EDI file is imported, the file name is key to identifying the trading partner and therefore the document template. See [Trading partners](../../CORE/Setup/Trading-partners.md) for further details.  It is based on this document template that the data within the file is identified and a record created in the EDI staging table in the next step.

> Note: The file mask is used to identify the trading partner and therefore template

### Step 2 - Import to staging - Inbound file validation
When the EDI file is retrieved and imported, there are various validations that are completed before the staging record is created in the EDI staging table.
If the processing of **Import to staging** errors, the Inbound file's **Status** will be set to _Error_ and no staging record created.

**Rule Id**         |	**Details**         
:--                 |:--                  
**Check Template**  |	Identify a template for the Trading partner/Document type. This will be used to identify the whereabouts of data within the file

#### Possible issues and fixes
**Import to staging** errors for EDI file can be viewed in:
- **EDI > Files > Inbound files** filtered to **Status** set to _Error_
- **EDI > Document maintenance**, tab **3PL documents**, tile **File import errors**

At this step the issues are usually around the file not matching the template.
- Does the file have the correct template assigned (General tab, field **Template**):
  - **No**: Use **Reset template** to assign a different template. If this should apply to future documents for the Trading partner, also update in **Trading partners**.
  - **Yes**: Review **Log** and fix the applicable template in **EDI > Setup > Document types**. Examples issues are date format, new field.

Example error for file not matching template: 'Segment '<xml' not found in EDI template mapping'

### Step 3 - Staging to target
If the processing of **Staging to target** errors, the staging record's **Staging to target status** will be set to _Error_ and the D365 Landed cost voyage won't be created/added to for the staging record.

#### Possible issues and fixes
**Staging to target** errors for Voyage creator can be viewed in:
- **EDI > Documents > Freight forwarder landed cost documents > Voyage creator** filtered to **Staging to target tatus** set to _Error_
- **EDI > Document maintenance**, tab **Freight forwarder landed cost documents**, tile **Voyage creator errors**
- **EDI > Document maintenance**, tab **Freight forwarder landed cost documents**, **Documents** page, tab **Voyage creator**

At this step the issues are usually around mapping/business logic issues. <br>
Review the **Log** or **Version log** for the applicable record to find the issue. <br>
Example errors and possible fixes are discussed in [FAQ](../INTRODUCTION/FAQ.md#voyage-creator).

### Staging line validation

![alt text](../IMAGE/LineChecks_FFVoyageCreator.png "Item checks for Voyage creator")

**Rule Id**                 | **Details**                                               | Error    
:---                        |:---                                                       |:---              
Purchase/Transfer order number	| Find the D365 purchase or transfer order number to which the voyage creator belongs	| Error at Staging table. <br>  No voyage created
No Valid Item	            | No valid item based on the different options available    | Error at Staging table. <br>  No voyage created

### Journey template calculation
The following fields from the EDI Voyage creator document is used when calculating the target Landed cost's Voyage field **Journey template**:
- From port
- To port
- Mode of delivery

> Note: If **multiple** journey templates are found, the staging-to-target step will error, and user will be able to select the correct **Journey template** in the staging page and process.

#### Example
Inbound file fields example:
- From port (ShipFromPort): CNSHA
- To port (ShipToPort): USLGB
- Mode of delivery (DlvModeId): SEA 

Our example mapped to delivery mode 40 on Trading partner, will find the following Journey template:

Journey template	| From port	    | To port	    | Mode of delivery	| Journey from port	    | Journey to port
:--                 |:--            |:--            |:--                |:--                    |:--
CNSHA-USLGB(S)	    | CNSHA	        | USLGB	        | 40	            | √	                    | √

**Journey template** (ShipJourneyId) field in the Voyage creator, also allows for inbound file to specify the Journey template which will then disregard the port and delivery mode fields. This field isn’t mandatory but provides flexibility.

### Duplicate tolerance
Document setting [Duplicate tolerance](../SETUP/SETTING-PROFILES/Voyage-creator.md) manages the outcome when an EDI Voyage creator document is received and the **Booking reference** is already used on an existing D365 Landed cost Voyage. The options are:
- **Accept** – Add to existing Open Voyage
- **Warning** – Creates new Voyage and staging record has Warning log
- **Error** – Staging record errors, and Voyage isn’t created

> Note: When the **Voyage status** assigned to the existing D365 Landed cost allows modification, the existing D365 Voyage is considered _Open_. 

## View staging table records
To view the Voyage creator staging records, go to **EDI > Documents > Freight forwarder landed cost documents > Voyage creator**. <br>
Use this page to review staging and process the EDI documents. Succesully processing to target adds the relevant purchase and/or transfer orders to an existing open Voyage (if document setting allows) or create new Voyage(s).
