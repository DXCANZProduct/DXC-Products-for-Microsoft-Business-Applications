# Shipment advice - Transfer order

The **Shipment advice - Transfer order** document enables companies to send inbound transfer order details to their 3PL warehouse. <br>
In return the 3PL will confirm receipt of the stock with document **Shipment receipt - Transfer order** which will post an arrival journal with optional document setting to receive the transfer order.

## Prerequisites
The following setup is prerequisites for the Shipment advice - Transfer order

### 3PL setup
EDI > Setup > 3PL setup
1. Create [Inventory status Id mapping](../SETUP/3PL-SETUP/Inventory-status-Id-mapping.md) to map the 3PL's values to D365 inventory statuses.

### Document type setup
EDI > Setup > Document types: Shipment advice - Transfer order
1. Create [Template](../../CORE/Setup/DocumentTypes/File-templates.md) for the document.
2. Create [Setting profile](../SETUP/SETTING-PROFILES/Shipment-advice-Transfer-order.md) for the document.
3. Create [Outbound file names](../../CORE/Setup/DocumentTypes/Outbound-filenames.md) for the document.

### Trading partners
EDI > Setup > Trading partners
1. If the warehouse [trading partner](../SETUP/Trading-partner.md) doesn't exist, create the new trading partner.
1. Assign the **3PL setup** to the warehouse trading partner's options:
    - Inventory status Id mapping: Options from **EDI > Setup > 3PL setup > Inventory status Id mapping**
1. Add and enable the **Shipment advice - Transfer order** document to the [3PL trading partner](../SETUP/Trading-partner.md) and select the applicable:
    - Template
    - Setting profile
    - File name setup

> Note: If the 3PL setup mappings are not assigned to the warehouse trading partner for an outbound document, the D365/EDI value will be sent, example inventory status of Available instead of a mapped value. <br>

## Processing

### Create shipment advice staging
An outbound shipment advice for transfer orders can be triggered via the following method: 
-	**Transfer order**: Inventory management > Inbound orders > Transfer order - Select **Ship transfer order** under the **Operations** heading on the **Ship** tab on the Action Pane. 

### Resend document
Users have the ability to resend the outbound shipment advice from **Transfer order history** on the Transfer order:
- Field **Sent to EDI** indicates if the shipment advice has been sent to the 3PL
- **Reset flag** changes **Sent to EDI** from Yes to No
- **Send to EDI** creates a new staging record and updates **Sent to EDI** from No to Yes

## Inbound document
Once the shipment has been received by the 3PL, the shipment receipt information is sent back via the inbound **Shipment receipt - Transfer order** document.
