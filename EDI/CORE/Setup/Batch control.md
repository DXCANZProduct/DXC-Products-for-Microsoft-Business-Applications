# EDI Batches

D365 batches provide the ability to schedule the various processes involved with the EDI module. To reduce the number of batches and simplify the configuration and maintenance a batch control form and workspace has been provided in which the EDI batches can be controlled from.

The EDI module process flow is made up of 5 basic steps:

| **Process**            				| **Description**                                                                                                                             	|
|------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| <ins>**Inbound documents**</ins>  	|                                                                                                                                             	|
| **Import**                 			| Files   are retrieved and imported into the modules inbound file staging area                                                          	 	|
| **Process to staging**     			| Files in the inbound file staging area are read and transformed based on the templates <br>into the EDI document type staging tables    			|
| **Process to target**      			| The EDI document type staging tables are processed to their target D365 documents and <br>business functions are performed.                     	|
| <ins>**Outbound documents**</ins> 	|                                                                                                                                             	|
| **Process to outbound**    			| EDI document type staging table records are processed based on the templates and files are <br>generated into the outbound file staging area    	|
| **Export**                 			| Files in the outbound file staging area are exported.                                                                                 		|

Each of these steps has a batch job that can be scheduled to automate it. Each of these batch jobs is run per company and will run over all enabled EDI document types. 
This has the following advantages:
- Different companies can have different batch schedules/frequencies and can be turned on or off separately
- Different alert rules can be applied to different companies
- Without reconfiguring or even stopping a batch job, individual document types can be enabled or disabled


Once the Batch control form is opened, the form will automatically display a list of all configured companies and within each of these the available EDI Document types as per the licence. Users can access the form by navigating to **EDI > Setup > Batch control**

For each of the 5 steps above, a separate fast tab will be displayed.  For each step:
- Option 1: Select Enable for each of the Documents and Connection types you would like to create a batch for, then select **Batch > Create Batch**
- Option 2: Alternatively for all documents, select **Batch > Create Batch**
- Enter the description of the batch in the **Caption** field
- Select the **Batch group**
- If you began setting up batch control with Option 2, select **Enable all documents** to setup up batch control for all licensed documents
- Import and Export batch: Select the applicable File transfer type (connection type) or leave blank if applies to all connection types.
- Update **Recurrence** and **Alerts** as required
- Select **Create Batch**
- Once the batches are created, documents and connection types can be enabled or disabled manually.
- To view the batch, select **Batch > View batch**
- Import and Export batch has to the option to create multiple batches on Batch Control

## **Maintain Batch Control**

Ongoing maintenance is an important aspect of D365 batches. The batch control form provides a status on the header of each fast tab as well as a link to the underlying batch job in the standard D365 form in which the standard batch logs can be found and updated.

## **EDI Batch Control Workspace**

To assist with monitoring of batch control, a workspace is available to show, at a glance, the status of EDI batches.  The workspace can be found by navigating to **EDI > EDI Batch Control**


### Active Batches
Shows all batch jobs that are currently active for each company and control type.  Each card shows:
- Batch Status
- Last run date and time
- Link to the batch details
- Link to the batch job history


### Missing batches
Shows all the batch jobs that havenâ€™t been setup. Option to filter by Company and/or EDI batch control type

## Export batch jobs
Outbound staging records can be created either by:
1.	**Send to EDI** is set to _Yes_ when posting the D365 source transaction, or
2.	**Change tracking** is utilised to determine if there are new records for the EDI document type. These documents require the **Export batch jobs** to create the outbound staging record based on the required recurrence.

The following section will describe the setup required for scenario 2.

### Create outbound records manually 
Users can access the form by navigating to **EDI > Periodic tasks > Export batch jobs**.

Create a new Export batch job by:
-	Select **New batch job**
-	Select the **Company**
-	Select the **EDI document type**
- Select the **Trading partner**, where relevant
- Set the **Recurrence**
- Select **OK**
