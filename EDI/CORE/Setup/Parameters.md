# EDI parameters
Users can access the form by navigating to **EDI > Setup > EDI Parameters**

## Refresh module
After each deployment, users should select the **Refresh module** button on the General Tab of EDI parameters.  
This option will refresh the modules artefacts and ensure the module is up to date.

## General
The parameters control the operation for the module per legal entity.
The EDI parameter’s Date format will be used to default Text document type’s Date formats. 
XML and JSON uses standard ISO formats, but can be overridden on a document level.

Leave XML and JSON as Standard date format to utilities the standard formats. 
If they are setup as Custom, the custom date and time format must be specified.
