# Customer

Integration systems Trading partner (example online sales site) may require customer data.

The following subsections will describe how to view, process and send Customer to applicable Integration system Trading partners. <br>
Viewing the [Staging table records](#view-staging-table-records) will also be discussed. <br>

## Prerequisites
The following setup is prerequisites for the Customer document:

1. Create [Template](../../CORE/Setup/DocumentTypes/File-templates.md) for the document.
2. Create [Outbound filenames](../../CORE/Setup/DocumentTypes/Outbound-filenames.md) for the document.
3. If the Integration systems [trading partner](../SETUP/Trading-partner.md) doesn't exist, create the new trading partner.
4. Add and enable the **Customer** document to the [Integration system trading partner](../SETUP/Trading-partner.md) and select the applicable:
    - Template
    - File name setup
    - Change tracking
5. Create a new batch job for the trading partner and document in [Export batch jobs](../../CORE/Setup/EDI-Batches.md#export-batch-jobs)

## Processing

### Change tracking

Integration documents are created by enabling change tracking on the trading partner's outgoing document(s).
The document change tracking's **Full** can be set to _Yes_, in order to send all the records for the tracked table.
Once the staging record has been created for the full version, the Document change tracking's **Full** field will automatically update to _No_ in order to send changes with the next batch run. <br> 
Document change tracking's **Update version** is also updated each time a staging record is created. Only changes after the **Update version** are added in the staging record.

If required to send full set of data again, the trading partner's document change tracking's **Full** can be set to _Yes_ again.

The following tables are tracked for the **Customer** document:
- CustTable
- DirPartyTable
- LogisticsElectronicAddress

To view the Customer staging records, go to **EDI > Documents > Integration systems documents > Master data > Out > Customer**. 
Use this page to review staging and process EDI Customer documents to an Outbound file.
