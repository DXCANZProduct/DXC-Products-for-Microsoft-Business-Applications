# Company Colors

### Company Colors Overview
Company colors allow a user to select a preferred color theme for a company. Standard D365 allows you to only define a color theme per user. This feature extends that capability to allow you to define a theme at company level. This will enable the user to differentiate each company by the color selected.
 
### Setup and Process
From the Legal Entity form you can set the color theme for the current selected company.

1. Navigate to **Organization administration > Organizations > Legal Entity**. 
2. Click on Edit button and expand the *Company color* fast tab and set *Enable Company color* to ‘Yes’. 
3. Choose the required color theme and save.

|  **Field**  | **Description** | 
|:---|:---|     
|  **Enable company color**  | **Enabled** - the selected color theme will be applied to all users. <br /> **Disabled** - the selected color theme will be applied to the current user.|   
|  **Color theme**  | List of available colour themes.|
