# DXC Core Extensions

## Release notes
The [release notes](Release-notes.md) describes the features that are either new or changed. 

## Solution Overview
DXC Core Extensions for Microsoft Dynamics 365 is a set of productivity utilities providing functionality to complement the standard Microsoft solution. Core Extensions includes the following components:

### [Company Colors](COMPANY-COLORS/Company-Colors.md)
Company colors allow a user to select a preferred color theme for a company. Standard D365 allows you to only define a color theme per user. This feature, however, extends that capability to allow you to define a theme at company level. This will enable the user to differentiate each company by the color selected.

### [Exchange Rate Import](EXCHANGE-RATE-IMPORT/Exchange-rate-import.md)
Microsoft Dynamics 365 offers functionality to import exchange rates based on limited sources. The Exchange Rate Import leverages the same standard framework of Microsoft Dynamics 365 but extends functionality to support the following additional sources; Reserve Bank of Australia, Bank of Canada, Open Exchange Rates.

### [User Security Audit Detail Report](USER-SECURITY-AUDIT-DETAIL-REPORT/User-Security-audit-detail-report.md)
The report “User security audit details report” included in the Core Extensions product gives an overview of the security setup for a user. The information shown on the report is down to the privilege level details.

### [General and Inventory Journal Import](JOURNAL-IMPORTS/General-and-inventory-journal-import.md)
The Import Journal functionality provides a user-friendly method to import general journal and inventory journal transaction data from Excel or CSV files. All the standard validation and defaulting will occur. Both General Journals and Inventory Journals are supported. The imports are based on Data Entities and allows configuration of new templates to be imported.

### [Business Process Links](BUSINESS-PROCESS-LINKS/Business-process-links.md)
The business process links feature allows you to setup associated links to forms when the user clicks on the Dynamics 365 Help icon. The associated links will display under the Process Links tab. This was designed for Mavim and SharePoint but will work for any external links.

### [Import Budgets](IMPORT-BUDGETS/Import-budgets.md)
The Import Budgets extension allows importing budget from Microsoft Excel templates where period budgets are presented in a traditional columnar format including dynamically adding financial dimensions and financial period across columns.
