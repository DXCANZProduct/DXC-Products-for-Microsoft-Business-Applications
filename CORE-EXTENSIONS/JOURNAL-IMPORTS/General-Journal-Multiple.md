# General Journal Import for multiple legal entities 
## Overview
The Import Journal functionality provides a user-friendly method to import general journal and inventory journal transaction data from Excel or CSV files. All the standard validation and defaulting occurs in the same way as the Data Management Framework (DMF). Both General Journals and Inventory Journals are supported. The imports are based on Data Entities and allow for the configuration of new templates to be imported. Note: Standard DMF source formatting and field mapping limitations apply.

Benefits:
* User-friendly for importing rather than having to open and paste into Excel, adding or using the data management workspace.
* Reduces the risk of making mistakes.
