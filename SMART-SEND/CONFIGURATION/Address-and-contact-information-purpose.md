# Address and contact information purpose
The Smart Send feature utilizes the standard Dynamics 365 for operations concept of an [Address and contact information purpose](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/set-up-address-and-contact-information-purposes), to define which contact information record should be applicable for use with the business form or report. 

To use the Smart Send feature at least one, ‘Address and contact information purpose,’ record should be configured for ‘Contact information’.
