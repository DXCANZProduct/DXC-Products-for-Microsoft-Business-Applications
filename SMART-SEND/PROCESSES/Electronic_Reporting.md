# Electronic reporting
Smart send supports the distribution of business documents generated by Electronic Reporting.

Installed and configured ER formats can be selected from the *Report format* column in [Smart send parameters](../CONFIGURATION/Parameters.md) To streamline processing it is recommended that these are set as the default report by enabling the *default* flag in [Smart send parameters](../CONFIGURATION/Parameters.md).

## Electronic reporting destinations
To enable an electronic report to be used via print management, an electronic report destination must be created for the selected report format. While multiple destinations can be enabled using electronic report destinations, at minimum the Smart Send destination must be enabled to send a document via Smart Send.

1. Navigate to: **Organization administration > Electronic reporting > Electronic reporting destinations**
2. Create a new electronic reporting destination record
3. Select from the *Reference* field the report format for printing
4. Create a new file destination
5. Enter a *Name*
6. Select from *File component name* the report format.
7. Select *Setting* to display available print destinations
8. Select Smart Send
9. Enable Smart Send 

## Print Management

When the matching default report from the Smart Send Email parameters is entered into the *report format* field as part of the Print management setup, Smart Send will generate a new ER Named Destination for the nominated form prefixed with "Smart Send" the first time the report is published, for example, Smart Send Purchase Order (Excel).  This defined destination for electronic reporting can then be modified to include additional outputs, such as Screen.
