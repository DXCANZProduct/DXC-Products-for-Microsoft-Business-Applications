# Automatic status update

[Automatic status change rules](../../SETUP/ITEM-SETUP/Automatic-status-change-rules.md) can be setup to update the item status based on certain events. For example, a status that indicates a low level of inventory can be updated to a discontinued status once the stock on hand becomes zero. The periodic job can be accessed from **Item creation > Periodic tasks > Item status > Automatic status update**.

1. Using the filter, select the _status_ being updated from and the _event_ being used
   - To run for all events, leave blank
2. Select OK.

_Note: Optionally select the Run in the background tab to run in batch processing. Please see [Microsoft User Guides](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/sysadmin/batch-processing-overview) for further information_
