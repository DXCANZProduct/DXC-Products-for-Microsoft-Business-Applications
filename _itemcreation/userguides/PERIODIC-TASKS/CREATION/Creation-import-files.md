# Creation import files

The creation import files form allows for the manual upload of one or more local files into D365. Imported files are staged in this form, visible as a tile with the _template name_ and _import file mask_ as a reference. On running the final stage of the process, _Creation item import_, a [creation import session](../../INQUIRIES/Creation-import-sessions) is created.

## Importing a file

1. Select the _template name_ the imported file will apply to. This will be the current version of the template and will only be visible if the version has been activated.
2. Select the _import file mask_ the imported file will be marked with.
3. Select _upload_ to browse and select a local file.
4. From the action pane, select _Creation item import_
5. Select the _template name_ and confirm to submit all staged files of this type for creation.

_Note: Steps 2 and 3 can be repeated if a template containers multiple file masks._

## Deleting a file

The delete icon can be located directly above the staged records, along side the filter field.

1. Mark the file/s.
2. Select the delete icon.
