### 2.1.3	Setting up item creation templates
#### 2.1.3.1	Create Template Tabs
 
 <b> Item creation > Setup > Item Creation > Item creation template tabs </b>
 
Item creation template tabs allow you to organise the data within the product template in a similar way that fast tabs organise data within list pages. It is possible to translate your Tabs for other languages that are used within your organisation.

1.	Click the <b> New </b> button.
2.	In the <b> Tab name </b> field enter a name for the Fast Tab within the creation template. 
3.	The <b> Position </b> will default depending on the record you had created this new tab name. 
4.	Click the up or down buttons to change the position of the fast tab. 
5.	To add translations to the Item creation template tabs
6.	Click the <b> Translations </b> button on the Item creation template tabs form to allow the organisations users to view the Tab name in their language of choice.     
7.	To add a translated text, click the + icon
8.	Select the language from the list of options.
9.	In the translated text field enter the translation for the tab name in the selected language.

#### 2.1.3.2	 Create Templates

<b> Item creation > Setup > Item creation > Item creation templates </b>

Use this feature to set up all your item creation templates and their respective values and requirements.  For example, you could set up a template per product type, in an apparel organisation this may be menswear / womenswear or shirts / dresses, in a toy manufacturer this could be wooden / metal or by age group etc...  
Getting the right balance between auto-completing as many fields as possible versus the number of templates is critical to the success of the ease of use.  As a rough guide between 10 and 50 templates is a sensible quantity.
