### 2.4.1	Update Single Item
**Item Creation > Products > Released Products > Item creation > Item status link (button)** 

The items status controls whether a product can be purchased, sales order (create a sales order), sales picking (create a pick list or output order) or sales return (allow sales returns). In addition, the status can be used by the business to determine where in its lifecycle the product is. The item status can be held at the item or item dimension level. The item status can be manually updated via the released products form. 

1.	The form will default to show **current records** once opened.  
2.	Enter the **as at date.** 
3.	Select **Apply.** 

*Note: The Item Status displayed at the top of the released products form is the item status at the item level, not the item dimension level.*
