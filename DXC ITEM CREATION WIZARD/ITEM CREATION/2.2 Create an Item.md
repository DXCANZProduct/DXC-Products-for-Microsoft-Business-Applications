## 2.2	Create an Item

<b> Item creation > Item creation > All creation items </b>

<br> Note: Also available for selection are the ‘Open creation items; and ‘Creation items assigned to me’. These forms work in the same manner as the ‘All creation items; however, they have been filtered to only show certain records.

Item creation extends on the standard AX functionality for creating/updating items.  It provides a streamlined way to create/update items, ensuring all required fields have been populated by different departments where necessary using workflow capabilities.  Once item information has been completed it is possible to approve item creation and release to multiple entities.

Note: There is an assumption that workflow has been created. For information on how to create workflows please refer to the standard Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, Enterprise Edition functionality
