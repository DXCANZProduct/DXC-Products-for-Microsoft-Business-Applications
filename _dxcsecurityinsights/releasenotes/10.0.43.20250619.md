22736 <br> 22158	| **Interaction type**	| Ability to log Form/Page Interaction types **Viewed** (only opened the form) vs **Edited** (modified / created records) for the accessed menu items. Enable this additional telemetry field by setting **Form edits (Page edits)** to _Yes_ on **Monitoring and telemetry parameters**.  This is useful, for example if the user only viewed Finance license type menu items, they could possibly be switched to a Team member / Activity license type role for the menu items. <br> ![Monitoring settings](IMAGES/ReleaseNotes_20250619_1.png "Monitoring settings") <br> <br>  Where there was no interaction, or the interaction was prior enabling the new monitoring field, the Interaction type will be Blank. <br> <br> Interaction type has also been added to the following two Security Insights forms. Please note the Interaction type is a display method on the license view. <br> ![User view](IMAGES/ReleaseNotes_20250619_2.png "User view")  <br> <br> ![License view](IMAGES/ReleaseNotes_20250619_3.png "License view")
