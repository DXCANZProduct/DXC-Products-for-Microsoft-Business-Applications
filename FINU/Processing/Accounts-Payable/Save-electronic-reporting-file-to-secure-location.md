## Save electronic reporting file to secure location

## Generate payment

If there is an error saving the file to secure location and **Stop processing on failure** on the **Electronic reporting destination** was enabled, the processing will error and **Payment status** remains None. Example error ‘The process stopped because the delivery of file ‘%’ to the destination failed. The payments cannot be generated.’
