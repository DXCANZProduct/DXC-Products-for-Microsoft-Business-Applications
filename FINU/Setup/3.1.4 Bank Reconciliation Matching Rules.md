### 3.1.4. Bank Reconciliation Matching Rules
#### 3.1.4.1	Group by Document Capability

D365 standard does not have the capability to match one transaction in the bank statement to multiple transactions in the D365 Bank Transactions that have the same journal id or cheque number. This functionality extends the automatic reconciliation matching rules by adding <b> ‘Group by document’. </b>

***<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The feature can be activated from Cash and bank management &gt;
Setup &gt; Advanced bank reconciliation setup &gt; Reconciliation matching rules </span>***

<table>
    <tr>
                 <td>  <b> Field  </b> </ td> 
                 <td>  <b>Description  </b> </ td>         
   </tr>   
    <tr>
       <td> <b> BASIC CRITERIA > Group by document number  </b></td>    
       <td> This feature combines the D365 bank transactions amount that have the same Document number (populated with the Journal id or check number) during the Bank reconciliation process, from Run matching rules.  </td> 	   
    </tr> 
        
</table>

#### 3.1.4.2 Matching Parameter - Included In
If the Parameter Extended matching rule operator is set to Yes, the option ‘Included in’ is available for selection, as shown in Step 1: Define the matching rule. 

When the Operator <b> Included in </b> is selected, Dynamics 365 checks whether the Value of the <b> Field </b> is included in the Value of the <b> Statement Fields </b>.

-	Contains (which is STD) means that the field Payment Reference in D365 contains the value of the Payment reference in the Bank File.
-	The Included in heading means that the field Payment Reference in D365 is included as a part of the value of the Payment reference in the Bank File.

<b> ‘Included in’ example: </b>
