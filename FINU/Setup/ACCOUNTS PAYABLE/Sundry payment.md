# Accounts payable functionality
The fields as described in the following subsections are available to control the additional functionality for accounts payable.

## Sundry payment

The functionality gives the ability to enter a supplier name and address on an individual invoice allowing these details to be used on cheque payments, as well as one-off BSB and Account Number for EFT Payments. Therefore, many one-time vendor invoices can be stored on a single sundry vendor record but allowing for separate payments without a change to the vendor record information.  This also makes it possible to pay all sundry invoices in one payment proposal.

### Setup Sundry payment
#### Method of Payment

Users can access the form by navigating to **Accounts payable > Payment setup > Methods of payment**.
A Sundry vendor needs its own method of payment. This is what differentiates the Sundry vendor from other vendors. A new **Method of payment** field called _Sundry method of payment_ has been added to record this.

|    Field	  |    Description   |
|-|-|
|   File Formats  |  |
|   Sundry method of payment  | Select _Yes_ for Sundry payment processing  |
	
#### Sundry Vendor

Define the Vendor to be used for Sundry payments, and set the **Method of payment** to the Sundry method of payment setup in previous step.
