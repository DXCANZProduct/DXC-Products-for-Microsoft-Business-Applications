# Encryption / Decryption
Encryption / Decryption is available utilising the **DXC Encryption** model.

Once below has been setup, the functionality can be used on the following Finance utilities functionality:
- Encrypt option on [Electronic reporting export connections](../ACCOUNTS-PAYABLE/Save-electronic-reporting-file-to-secure-location.md) to send encrypted GER Vendor EFT files
- Decrypt option on [Financial utilities connection](../CASH-AND-BANK-MANAGEMENT/Finance-utilities-connections.md) to decrypt a bank statement file imported using periodic task **Import bank statements via financial utilities connection**


## Step 1 - Setup Secrets in Key vault parameters
Setup the following as **Secrets** in **Key vault parameters** for the encryption/decryption:
- Phassprase - Longer version of a password used to encrypt the sender's private key using a hash of the passphrase as the secret key
- Private key - Sender's private key
- Public key -  Sender's public key
- Receiver's public key - Receiver's public key (used for decryption)

Files are encrypted and signed with the sender's private key, receiver's public key, and the pass phrase. <br>
Files are verified and decrypted with the recipient's private key, sender's public key and the pass phrase.

PGP uses a passphrase to encrypt your private key on your machine. Your private key is encrypted on your disk using a hash of your passphrase as the secret key. You use the passphrase to decrypt and use your private key. A passphrase should be hard for you to forget and difficult for others to guess.

> Note: It's recommended to for the Private key, Public key, Receiverâ€™s public key use Azure Storage SAS URL with read only access stored in the keyvault secrets. The SAS url points to the file and includes the token to access it.

## Step 2 - Assign Secrets in DXC encryption parameters
Assign above **Secrets** to the encryption/decryption. <br>
To open the **DXC encryption parameters** page, go to **Organization administration > Setup > DXC encryption > DXC encryption parameters**. <br>

Select **New** and set the fields as described in the following subsection.

Field                       | Description                         
:--                         |:--                        
**Encryption key name**     | Enter a unique name for the encryption
**Passphrase**              |	Select the applicable **Secret** from **Key vault parameters**
**Private key**             |	Select the applicable **Secret** from **Key vault parameters**
**Public key**              |	Select the applicable **Secret** from **Key vault parameters**
**Receiver's public key**     |	Select the applicable **Secret** from **Key vault parameters**

## Step 3 - Use Encryption in Finance utilities

Assign to Finance utilites functionality:
- Encrypt option on [Electronic reporting export connections](../ACCOUNTS-PAYABLE/Save-electronic-reporting-file-to-secure-location.md) to send encrypted GER Vendor EFT files
- Decrypt option on [Financial utilities connection](../CASH-AND-BANK-MANAGEMENT/Finance-utilities-connections.md) to decrypt a bank statement file imported using periodic task **Import bank statements via financial utilities connection**.

Setup: 

Field                       | Description                         
:--                         |:--                        
**Enable file encryption/decryption**     | Set to _Yes_
**Encryption key name**                   | Select applicable **Encryption key name** setup in Step 2
