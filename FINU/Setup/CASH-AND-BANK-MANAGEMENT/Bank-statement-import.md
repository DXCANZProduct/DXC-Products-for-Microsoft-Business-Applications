## Bank statement periodic import
When the bank statements are to be imported via the periodic task **Import bank statements via financial utilities connection**, the following prerequisites are required.

### Prerequisites
1.	Setup [Financial utilities connection](Finance-utilities-connections.md)
1.	Setup [Bank accounts](Bank-accounts.md):
   - Select applicable **Financial utilities connection** - Optional (for info)

### Optional
1. Setup **File attachment document type** on [Financial utilities parameters](Finance-utilities-parameters.md) to attach the import file to the created D365 Bank statement(s).

### Batch job
After the prerequisites have been completed, setup required batch job(s) by using **Cash and bank management > Periodic tasks > Import bank statements via financial utilities connection**

Field         | Description                         | Mandatory
:--           |:--                                  |:--:
**Financial utilities connection**  |	Select the applicable Financial utilities connection  |	Y
**Statement format**  |	Select the applicable bank statement format	  | Y

### Bank statement
**Cash and bank management > Bank statement reconciliation > Bank statements**. <br>
Filter **Imported via financial utilities connection** on the **Bank statement** form, provides users with the ability to filter to bank statements imported via the batch job. <br>
If the file contains any bank accounts that can't be found in D365, no bank statements will be created, and the file will be moved from the Import to **Error path** as setup on the Financial connection.

Where the Statement format selected in the Batch job, is a **Custom format**, the created bank statementâ€™s:
- **From date** - will be set to earliest date found in the file
- **To date** - will be set to latest date found in the file
