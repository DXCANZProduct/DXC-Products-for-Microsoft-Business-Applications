## 3.5.	Payment Reference Activation
The ability to automatically generate Payment Reference numbers when generating EFT bank files is included in the Cash and Bank Management section where the following set up is required. 

To activate the Document number; 
You can reach the Bank reconciliation – Turn off reconciliation worksheet parameter form by navigating to

**- CASH AND BANK MANAGEMENT > SETUP > CASH AND BANK MANAGEMENT PARAMETERS </b> - Bank reconciliation – Turn off reconciliation worksheet parameters** – set to **Yes**

You can reach the ACCOUNTS PAYABLE PARAMETERS form by navigating to

**-	ACCOUNTS PAYABLE > SETUP > ACCOUNTS PAYABLE PARAMETERS** – Number sequences - set the Payment reference number sequence

The enhancement to support the ‘Group by document number’ feature is to display the Journal id or Check number under Document number field on the bank reconciliation screen. Matching rules can then be used to automatically match the sum of the D365 transactions having the same document number as that on the Bank statement.
