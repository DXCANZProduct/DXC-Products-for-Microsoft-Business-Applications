# Deprecated features

This section describes the features that have been removed, or planned to be removed from a Finance utilities version.

### Vendor bank account change workflow
- Reason for deprecation/removal - Replaced by D365 feature from 10.0.32 called 'Vendor bank account change proposal workflow' / 'Supplier bank account change proposal workflow'. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dynamics365/finance/accounts-payable/vendor-bank-account-workflow)
- Impact - Removal of the following fields in Accounts payable parameters FastTab 'Vendor approval':
	- Bank account number
	- Bank account BSB
	- Bank account biller code (Finance utilities field)
	- Bank account lodgement reference (Finance utilities field)
	- Bank account bank group
	- Bank account SWIFT code
	- Bank account IBAN
	- Bank account active date
	- Bank account expiration date
- Notice date - 24 July 2023
- Status - Completed in 10.0.36.202311161
> Note: The Finance utilities fields (Biller code and Lodgement reference) have been added to standard 'Vendor bank account approval' FastTab in Accounts payable parameters in Finance Utilities version 10.0.35.202307311.

### New bank statement transaction - Posting date
- Finance Utilities functionality - Option to post **new** bank statement transaction at either **Today's date** or **Statement transaction date** (Statement's To date)
- Recommended process: Feature 'New voucher and date for new transactions in the advanced bank reconciliation bank statement' is automatically enabled from 10.0.36. The feature automatically sets new 'Cash and bank management parameters' field 'Set the booking date as default accounting date for new transactions' to _Yes_. Select applicable option in this new field to set the default accounting date for new transactions:
	- Yes: Bank statement line booking date
 	- No: Bank statement import date 
- Reason for deprecation/removal - Feature 'New voucher and date for new transactions in the advanced bank reconciliation bank statement' was introduced in 10.0.31. In 10.0.35 MS has updated the feature which has resulted in a breaking change for Finance Utilities Posting date functionality. From 10.0.36 this feature is enabled by default.
- Impact - Removal of the following fields & functionality:
	- Posting date default on bank account <br>
	- Posting date option on importing bank statement <br>
 	- Posting date on bank reconciliation <br>
- Notice date - 4 September 2023
- Status - Completed in 10.0.36.202311161

15199		| Cash and bank management	| Reconciliation matching rules	set | Extension to **processMatchRuleSet** to support reprocessing unmatched bank statement lines. <br> The issue came in where the filter criteria for each rule in the set found the same bank statement lines, but the rules used different bank statement fields to find the D365 customer account to post the customer payment journal. <br> <br> Example - Reconciliation matching rule set where all the rules filters to same criteria that matches to 15 bank statement lines: <br> Rule 1: Uses Bank statement field **Description** to find the D365 customer account, but only 3 lines could find a D365 customer account in this field to successfully post. <br> Rule 2: Uses Bank statement field **Entry reference** to find the D365 customer account. The expectation would be that Rule 2 would find the remaining 12 bank statement lines and post the applicable ones, but it found 0. <br> Before this change, only rule 1 in the set found bank statement lines, and subsequent rules found 0.
15390		| Cash and bank management	| Bank reconciliation	| When running a **Mark new transactions** Reconciliation matching rule that: <br> • Posts customer payment journals and <br> • Financial utilities parameters **Only match posted statement lines** was set to _Yes_ and <br> • **No** journals were successfully posted (for example couldn't find any matching D365 customer account for all the lines) <br> All unmatched bank statement transactions, that matched the criteria, where moved to matched.

# Installation process
To align with MS best practice and to protect our IP the following applies to the release process.
- The license models DXCLicense and Sable37License will only be released as binaries as part of a deployable package. 
- We will not provide test models for the products, neither as binary or source code. 
- We will only publish the release as a deployable package. 
- Model source code can be provided at our discretion. It can be requested for debugging upgrade errors, or if required for extensions.
	- If you have been given the source code to our model for extension or debugging purpose, never make modifications directly to our models! 
	- If you need an extension point, please send an email to ECLANZProductSupport@dxc.com and request it to be implemented. 


Depending on the installation history follow one of these guides to install the new release. 
## Installation without existing installed product
1. Apply the deployable package to your environment. 
2. If you have requested any model for extension or debugging purposes. Install the model source code. 
a.	Note, once the model source code is compiled it will overwrite the binaries installed when the deployable package was applied. 



## Installation with existing installed product
If you’re installing the new release in an installation that already has a previous version of the product installed and you’re not using it for debugging or extension. We recommend that you;  
1. Remove the release product model source code from your source control, if source control is used. 
2. Apply the deployable package, installing the latest version of the product models as binaries.  
3. Check in the binaries for the models to source control, if source control is used. 

If you’re using our model source code for extension or debugging and would like to continue using it, please do the following to apply the new release with the source code. 

1. Remove product license model from your source control that is applicable to the release. You’ll find the license model in the deployable package. It will either be called DXCLicense and Sable37License. 
2. Apply the deployable package to your environment to install the latest binaries. Check in the binaries for the license model that was removed in step 1 to source control. Note, this step will also install the binaries for all the models in the new release. 
3. Install the product release model source code and check into source control. 

If you don’t follow these instructions and continue building your installation deployable package using the license model source code, the installation will continue using the same license model as before applying the release.
