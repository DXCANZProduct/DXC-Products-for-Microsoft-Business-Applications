# Document Types

The **Document Types** page allows users to configure which documents will use the Docusign integration when processing. When a document is set on this page, the document will be sent via Docusign for review and approval. The selected document will use the linked template to determine the details of the signature required and send the detail of the signatory along with the design of the report output.

The Docusign integration will work with any report that has an SSRS report type output, and will send all of the details regarding the report design to Docusign at the time the document is processed. The **Document types** page is found by navigating to **Organization administration > Setup > Docusign > Document types**.

The following fields are available on the **Document types** page. It is defined in three sections:

- **Document type**
- **General**
- **Advanced**

## Document type

The **Document type** FastTab identifies the report name details of the document at processing time.
