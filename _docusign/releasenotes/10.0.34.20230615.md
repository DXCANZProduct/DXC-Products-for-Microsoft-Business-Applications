# Installation process

To align with MS best practice and to protect our IP the following applies to the release process.

- The license models DXCLicense and Sable37License will only be released as binaries as part of a deployable package.
- We will not provide test models for the products, neither as binary or source code.
- We will only publish the release as a deployable package.
- Model source code can be provided at our discretion. It can be requested for debugging upgrade errors, or if required for extensions.
  - If you have been given the source code to our model for extension or debugging purpose, never make modifications directly to our models!
  - If you need an extension point, please send an email to ECLANZProductSupport@dxc.com and request it to be implemented.

Depending on the installation history follow one of these guides to install the new release.

## Installation without existing installed product

1. Apply the deployable package to your environment.
2. If you have requested any model for extension or debugging purposes. Install the model source code.
   a. Note, once the model source code is compiled it will overwrite the binaries installed when the deployable package was applied.

## Installation with existing installed product

If you’re installing the new release in an installation that already has a previous version of the product installed and you’re not using it for debugging or extension. We recommend that you;

1. Remove the release product model source code from your source control, if source control is used.
2. Apply the deployable package, installing the latest version of the product models as binaries.
3. Check in the binaries for the models to source control, if source control is used.

If you’re using our model source code for extension or debugging and would like to continue using it, please do the following to apply the new release with the source code.

1. Remove the product license model from your source control that is applicable to the release. You’ll find the license model in the deployable package. It will either be called DXCLicense and Sable37License.
2. Apply the deployable package to your environment to install the latest binaries. Check in the binaries for the license model that was removed in step 1 to source control. Note, this step will also install the binaries for all the models in the new release.
3. Install the product release model source code and check into source control.

If you don’t follow these instructions and continue building your installation deployable package using the license model source code, the installation will continue using the same license model as before applying the release.
